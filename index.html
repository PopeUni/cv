      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a student at the University of Newcastle
        who is currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science majoring in software
        development. I am also a beginner web developer who is looking to gain more skills and experience

        <h3>Languages and software </h3>
        <p>Over my 4 years at University i have developed many skills used to create and design web applications. My degree has given me
          the opportunity to increase my both my backend and frontend skills which in 2020 I was able to put into practice by completing
          250 hours of unpaid work integrated learning with the company Cloudsense

        <h3>Soccer</h3>
        <p>Outside of work and University I like to keep up with various soccer leagues, I have played the sport for many years starting when i was still
        very young. I believe playing has helped to lay the ground work for many team management and communication skills I still use today</p>
